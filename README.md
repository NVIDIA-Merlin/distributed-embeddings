distributed-embeddings is a library for building large embedding based (e.g. recommender) models in Tensorflow 2. It provides a scalable model parallel wrapper that automatically distribute embedding tables to multiple GPUs, as well as efficient embedding operations that cover and extend Tensorflow's embedding functionalities.

## Features

### Distributed model parallel wrapper
`distributed_embeddings.dist_model_parallel` is a tool to enable model parallel training by changing only three lines of your script. It can also be used alongside data parallel to form hybrid parallel training. Users can easily experiment large scale embeddings beyond single GPU's memory capacity without complex code to handle cross-worker communication.

### Embedding Layers

`distributed_embeddings.Embedding` combines functionalities of `tf.keras.layers.Embedding` and `tf.nn.embedding_lookup_sparse` under a unified Keras layer API. The backend is designed to achieve high GPU efficiency.
